![AV Recipe Book Logo](./src/assets/burger.png "AV RecipeBook Cover Cover")

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/a7da9937-1e45-4a3c-9323-d1d5f07a2ed8/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/av-recipe-book/deploys)

## Description
Have learned VueJS and ReactJS now it is time to finally try Angular and see how it differs from other frameworks. This is a Udemy Angular course project still in progress but already added Netlify pipeline.

To learn more than the course gives me, I chose to go with different tools - Stylus & PUG compared to what instructor chose (regular HTML and CSS files).
