## Description
Have learned VueJS and ReactJS now it is time to finally try latest Angular and see how it differs from other frameworks. 

This is a Udemy Angular course project which I decided to improve in many ways to learn more than the course gives me:
* used `PUG` framework instead of regular HTML
* used `Stylus` CSS pre-processor instead of regular CSS
* added color theme
* responsivness on different devices
* storing changes automatically
* test user
* animations
* unit of measure for ingredients

#### [Demo](https://av-recipe-book.netlify.app/)

## Clone & Run Locally
