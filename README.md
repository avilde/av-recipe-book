## Description
Have learned VueJS and ReactJS now it is time to finally try Angular and see how it differs from other frameworks. This is a Udemy Angular course project still in progress but already added Netlify pipeline.

To learn more than the course gives me, I chose to go with different tools - Stylus & PUG compared to what instructor chose (regular HTML and CSS files).
